Run C++ Code on VS Code on Linux

The goal here is to run C++ programs on a Linux box using Visual Studio Code, including the ability to debug / step through code.  These samples show a progression of making this work.    Please note, this is a work in progress... I'm trying to learn this stuff... been awhile since I've really used C/C++ for anything.  I'm sure there are plenty of errors (opportunities for improvement) here.  Feel free to raise [an issue!](https://github.com/zipzit/vscode_cpp_projects/issues)


## 1_cpp_helloworld
 - Keep it simple. 
 - Simple gcc compilation, generated via C/C++ Extension tools
 - Simple gdb debugging
 
## 2_cmake_helloworld
 - Same simple program
 - Use Cmake via CMakeLists.txt
 - Use LLDB for debugging
 
## 3_cmake_simple_include
 - Introduce a simple class structure with separate header file
 
## 4_cmake_template_class
 - No compilation lessons here...
 - I wanted to understand how template functions worked
 
## 5_cmake_vcpkg
 - Lots going on here.. and I'm sure errors abound... 
 - We're using vcpkg, a package manager for C++ libraries.  Its an impressive setup.
 - This simple sample uses `fmt`just so we can easily test the process of using a vcpkg library.
 - The vcpkg tools is creating the content well, but there are problems in the Cmake link / include processing.  This was way too much stubby pencil work.  
 - Again, this is a work in progress.
 
## 6_cmake_opencv_intro
 - OpenCV compiled and installed manually from github source
 - Works well.
